# Object-Oriented Java Programming Project

Project made for an Object-Oriented Java Programming course in Singapore Management University.

Project Description:
* Social networking sites such as Facebook have become ubiquitous platforms for communication. A social network is a means of keeping track of a set of people and the relationships between them. 
* For this project, we are going to write a simple social networking application called Social Magnet. In Social Magnet, a member has a wall containing his personal information, and the last few messages to the wall. All members are automatically players of an integrated farming game called City Farmers. In the game, the farmer (i.e. the player) manages a virtual farm by planting, growing and harvesting virtual crops.

Concepts used: 
* OOP
* UML Diagrams
* JDBC
* MySQL
* Maven
